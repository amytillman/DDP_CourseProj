Background
========================================================

This R presentation is for the JHU Coursera Developing Data Products Course Project.

Shiny application is available here: https://amytillman.shinyapps.io/DDPShinyApp/  

R source code is available here: https://github.com/amytillman/DDP_CourseProj  


Shiny App
========================================================

The Shiny application is hosted on a platform called shinyapps.io and 
has two input files: ui.R and server.R.  

The application uses the diamonds dataset from the ggplot2 R package along with 
the following R packages: rsconnect (used to publish/host the app on shinyapps.io),
shiny, tidyverse (includes ggplot2), RColorBrewer, and patchwork.


Diamond data
========================================================

Diamond price in the diamonds dataset ranges from 326 to 18,823 US dollars.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data("diamonds")
summary(diamonds[,c("price","carat")])
```


Shiny App cont'd
========================================================

The 3 scatterplots in this Shiny app display diamond price vs. carat 
for diamond cut, color, and clarity, respectively.

In order to view different diamond characteristics based on price range, the user 
will first specify a minimum and maximum diamond price in US dollars. 

Next, the user will press the Submit button which will prompt a refresh of the 3 
scatterplots based on the user-specified diamond price range.

Enjoy some diamond exploration while using this Shiny app!
